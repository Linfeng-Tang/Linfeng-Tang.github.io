Hi, I am [**Linfeng Tang**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PyRqpAsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (唐霖峰).

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the **School of Robotics**, **Wuhan University**, working with Prof. [Jiayi Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=73trMQkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University in **December 2025**, advised by Prof. [Jiayi Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=73trMQkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Prior to that, I obtained my B.E. degree from Central South University in 2020.

My research interests primarily focus on **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**, with a specific emphasis on:
* **Information Fusion** (Multi-modal Image Fusion, Video Fusion)
* **Image Enhancement** (Low-light Enhancement, Restoration)
* **Visual-Semantic Understanding**

I have published 15+ papers in top-tier conferences and journals, including **NeurIPS, IEEE TPAMI, IJCV, ACM MM**, and **Information Fusion**. My work has been recognized with the **Information Fusion Best Paper Award (2024)** and the **Hsue-shen Tsien Paper Award (2023)**. I was also listed in the **World's Top 2% Scientists** by Stanford University (2025).
